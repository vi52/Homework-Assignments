This repository contains projects from my undergraduate coding classes. They are organized into folders by class:
* [Data Structures](DataStructures): an introductory python class
* [Object Orientated Programming](ObjectOrientatedProgramming): an introductory java class
* [Web and Database Development](WebAndDatabaseDevelopment): covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL
## Running the assignments
For the Data Structures class, only projects 4 and 5 will run. The rest require accompanying external text files (used as data for the project scenarios) that are no longer available to me. Projects 4 and 5 will run in the terminal with:
```{shell}
python Project4-Stack.py
```
For the Object Orientated Programming class, all projects should run as expected. They can be run in JRE, or in the terminal with:
```{shell}
java Project1.java
```
For the Web and Database Development class, the projects will run by double clicking the downloaded document in the files application. Project 1 will not run correctly as it requires particular image files.
